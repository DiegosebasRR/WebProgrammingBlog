        Components are reusable units of code for your HTML pages. These could
        be Astro components, or UI framework components like React or Vue. It is
        common to group and organize all of your project components together in
        this folder. This is a common convention in Astro projects, but it is
        not required. Feel free to organize your components however you like!
